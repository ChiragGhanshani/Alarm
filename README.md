Requirements:
	Python 2.7.3
	MPlayer (sudo apt-get install mplayer <- Debian)

To install this script, simply add it to your path and call it from the terminal.

To select the music file for the alarm, ensure that it is in the directory form which you are calling
alarm.py.

Planned Features:
	Exact time specification for the alarm (eg. 8AM)
	Play playlists of music (possibly based on the day of the week)
	auto snooze
	{more features will be added as I think of them}
